## Guideline to Add Illustration

To add illustrations, you can read the detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/Anmol-Baranwal/Awesome-Illustrations-4Projects#-how-to-contribute-)

You can add individual illustrations, each with their unique pack, even if the entire group has already been added to the Group category.

In case you are searching for new illustrations to add to the repository collection, I recommend taking a look at [this resource](https://github.com/Anmol-Baranwal/Awesome-Illustrations-4Projects/issues/43). It contains a collection of illustrations for those who are eager to make their contributions and join the creative journey.
